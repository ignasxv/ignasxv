Tao Te Ching 63
為無為，                    Act without doing;
事無事，                      work without effort.
味無味。大小多少，           Think of the small as large
報怨以德。                    and the few as many.
圖難於其易，                Confront the difficult
為大於其細；                 while it is still easy;
天下難事必作於易，          accomplish the great task
天下大事必作於細             by a series of small acts.

Lao Tzu (translation by S. Mitchell)
